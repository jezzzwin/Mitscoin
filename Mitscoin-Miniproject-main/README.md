In the ongoing internet boom across the world and the mission of
Digital Indiato simplify every aspect of life, why should we Mitsians
stay behind? All of us have experienced that whenever we want to
buy/pay for something, we either don't have the money, or we have
too much money, i.e. the shopkeepers have no change to pay us
back!
OBJECTIVE
This project aims to develop a fully functional website that will
cater the needsof tech-savvy MITSians which will enable the user to
pay for every service available in MITS minus the hassle of buying
goods offline with a comfortable User Interface with a secure
database and a proper transaction history that will make life much
more easier, benefitting both the buyers and the sellers.
Front-end / Client Side:
The top most visible layer is whatâ€™s called the Front-end. It is
written in HTML and CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity
and function. The data from this layer has to make it to the user's
browser which then turns all the code into something beautiful and
interactive.
Back-end/ Server Side:
The "Backend" is where we usually use a programming language
(unlike HTML & CSS which are markup languages) such as PHP,
Python, Ruby , Java, SQL.
Connectivity
It uses XAMMP for compiling and running the complete project.
Localhost is used to refer to the current device used to access it.
